# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

The general problem that our project is trying to solve is the creation of an efficient and user-friendly shoe website. The focus of this interval of work, Phase 3, was to develop a functional prototype of the website and gather user feedback through usability testing.  

## Methods

- Prototype Development: We utilized Adobe XD to create a functioning prototype of the shoe website. This involved designing the website's layout, implementing interactive features, and integrating sample shoe products.  

- Usability Testing: We conducted usability tests with our classmates as participants. The purpose of these tests was to observe how users interacted with the prototype and gather their feedback on various aspects such as navigation, search functionality, product details, and overall user experience.  

- Test Scenario Design: We created realistic test scenarios for participants to perform specific tasks on the prototype. These scenarios were designed to simulate real-world usage scenarios and allowed us to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the website's features.  

- Data Collection: During the usability tests, we collected both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data included participants' observations, comments, and suggestions, which were recorded through direct observations and post-task interviews. Additionally, we used quantitative measures such as task completion time and success rates to assess the usability of the prototype.  

- Data Analysis: We analyzed the collected data by reviewing observations, comments, and suggestions from participants. We identified common themes and patterns in their feedback to gain insights into usability issues, strengths, and areas for improvement in the prototype.  

## Findings

- Users found the overall design and layout of the prototype visually appealing and intuitive.

- Filter Button Visibility: Users had difficulty spotting the filter button initially. This indicates a potential issue with the visibility or placement of the filter button within the interface. Improving the visual prominence and clarity of the filter button could help users easily locate and utilize this important feature.  

- Appreciation for Simplistic Design: Users expressed appreciation for the simplistic design of the website. This feedback suggests that the clean and uncluttered interface resonated well with users. Continuing to prioritize simplicity in the design approach is recommended to maintain a positive user experience.  

- Users expressed a desire for more detailed product descriptions, including materials used, sizing information, and customer reviews.  

- Participants praised the quick loading times, indicating positive performance.  

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
