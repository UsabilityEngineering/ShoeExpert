# Phase III: Prototypes and User Testing

## Introduction

In Phase III of the project, we build upon the progress made in Phase II, with a primary focus on enhancing the user experience of our website using prototypes. This phase includes activities like refining wireframes and actively involving users in testing a prototype that closely resembles the actual website, allowing us to gather valuable feedback and insights.  

## Methods

- Prototype Development: We utilized Adobe XD to create a functioning prototype of the shoe website. This involved designing the website's layout, implementing interactive features, and integrating sample shoe products.  

- Usability Testing: We conducted usability tests with our classmates as participants. The purpose of these tests was to observe how users interacted with the prototype and gather their feedback on various aspects such as navigation, search functionality, product details, and overall user experience.  

- Test Scenario Design: We created realistic test scenarios for participants to perform specific tasks on the prototype. These scenarios were designed to simulate real-world usage scenarios and allowed us to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the website's features.  

- Data Collection: During the usability tests, we collected both qualitative and quantitative data. Qualitative data included participants' observations, comments, and suggestions, which were recorded through direct observations and post-task interviews. Additionally, we used quantitative measures such as task completion time and success rates to assess the usability of the prototype.  

- Data Analysis: We analyzed the collected data by reviewing observations, comments, and suggestions from participants. We identified common themes and patterns in their feedback to gain insights into usability issues, strengths, and areas for improvement in the prototype.  

## Findings

- Users found the overall design and layout of the prototype visually appealing and intuitive.

- Users had difficulty spotting the filter button initially. This indicates a potential issue with the visibility or placement of the filter button within the interface. Improving the visual prominence and clarity of the filter button could help users easily locate and utilize this important feature.  

- Users expressed appreciation for the simplistic design of the website. This feedback suggests that the clean and uncluttered interface resonated well with users. Continuing to prioritize simplicity in the design approach is recommended to maintain a positive user experience.  

- Users expressed a desire for more detailed product descriptions, including materials used, sizing information, and customer reviews.  

- Participants praised the quick loading times, indicating positive performance.  

## Conclusions

Phase III of the project builds upon Phase II, incorporating methods such as wireframe design, cognitive walkthroughs, and user feedback from prototype testing to enhance the website’s usability. There was important information gained from the user’s insights about these activities that allowed us to identify strengths such as strong, simplistic, and fast loading times. Users also gave us areas to improve on such as making the filters more accessible and easy to use, as well as having the ability to expand on shoes and see more pictures and details. Moving on we plan to add these features to our final website.

## Caveats

The usability tests conducted during this phase involved a small demographic of people from our single section of the class. While their insights helped us improve, it is important to acknowledge that these findings may not represent the preferences and needs of a larger population of users. Future research should aim to include more participants, participants from diverse backgrounds and demographics in order to obtain a better understanding of user needs.

The findings and conclusions drawn from the usability tests are based on the direct feedback of users. However, individual opinions, biases, and preferences may still vary. It is important to consider the range of user feedback as well as commonly followed practices in UX design in order to make decisions for the future.  
The prototype used in the usability tests was a functional but limited representation of the final website due to the fact that it is a wireframe. Certain features and functionalities may not have been fully explored or implemented in the prototype, such as not being able to select more than one filter at a time, and the option to fully expand on a shoe which could influence user perceptions and feedback. We recommend further testing with a more complete and refined prototype in order to have more accurate results.
