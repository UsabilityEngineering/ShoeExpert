# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction

The general problem that the Shoe Expert project is trying to solve is the difficulty in finding the right pair of shoes that meet the user's unique needs and preferences. With so many different shoe options on the market, it can be challenging to know which shoes are the best for various activities, foot sizes, and personal style.  

## Methods

To discover new insights into users' needs, we employed several research methods:

1. Competitor analysis: We conducted a thorough analysis of existing shoe recommendation websites to identify similar websites and their strengths and weaknesses.  

2. User personas: We created fictional user personas based on the insights gained from the competitor analysis to represent the target audience of Shoe Expert.  

3. Wireframing: We created several wireframes to explore different design options and layouts for Shoe Expert.  

## Findings

1. Competitor analysis:  
 - Existing shoe recommendation websites are often cluttered and difficult to navigate.  
 - Most competitor websites rely on general recommendations and do not take into account the user's unique needs and preferences.  
 - Some competitor websites offer personalized recommendations based on a user's activity and foot size, but they lack comprehensive filtering options.  

2. User personas:  
 - The target audience for Shoe Expert is diverse, including individuals of different ages, genders, and activity levels.  
 - Users are looking for a personalized and intuitive shoe recommendation website.  
 - Users want the ability to filter their shoe options based on different criteria, such as size, color, and activity.  
 
3. Wireframing:  
 - A minimalist and intuitive design with clear filtering options is crucial for user engagement.  
 - A simple and easy-to-use interface with a focus on personalization is recommended.  

## Conclusions

The insights gained from the research methods suggest that Shoe Expert needs to offer a personalized and intuitive shoe recommendation website. Users are looking for a minimalist and easy-to-use interface that takes into account their unique needs and preferences. The website should include comprehensive filtering options that allow users to narrow down shoe options based on different criteria, such as size, color, and activity. Based on these findings, we recommend that Shoe Expert focus on the following design recommendations:  
 - A minimalist and intuitive design with a focus on personalization.  
 - Comprehensive filtering options that allow users to narrow down shoe options based on different criteria, such as size, color, and activity.  
 - A simple and easy-to-use interface that prioritizes the user's unique needs and preferences.  

## Caveats

The research methods we used had some limitations. The competitor analysis was limited to a small sample size of shoe recommendation websites and may not represent the entire population of potential Shoe Expert competitors. Additionally, the wireframes we created are not finalized designs and may need to be revised based on user feedback in future phases.
