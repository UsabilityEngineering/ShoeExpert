# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

The Phase II of the project aimed at enhancing the user experience (UX) of our application. We conducted several activities, including designing wireframes and gathering informal user feedback from the SE and UX team.

## Methods

1. Wireframe Design: We created wireframes for the application, incorporating the feedback received during Phase I. The wireframes served as visual representations of the application's layout and functionality, helping us to further refine the design and flow.  

2. Cognitive Walkthroughs: Our classmates conducted cognitive walkthroughs using the first generation of wireframes. This involved analyzing the application from a given personaâ€™s perspective, identifying potential usability issues, and suggesting improvements. The feedback received was predominantly positive, with an overall understanding of the application's flow and purpose.  

3. Informal User Feedback: We gathered informal feedback from fellow classmates, which provided valuable insights into their experience using the application. The feedback highlighted the need for expansion in certain areas to provide a more comprehensive solution.  

## Findings

1. Usability strengths: The cognitive walkthroughs helped us identify several strengths in the application's usability, including intuitive navigation, clear call-to-actions, and straightforward workflows.  

2. Areas for improvement: The informal user feedback and cognitive walkthroughs also pointed out areas that require further improvement, such as expanding the functionality of certain features and enhancing the visual design for better user engagement.  

3. Importance of feedback: Feedback from both the SE team and cognitive walkthroughs played a crucial role in identifying the application's strengths and weaknesses, helping us make informed decisions for further improvements.  

## Conclusions

Phase II of the project involved wireframe design, cognitive walkthroughs, and informal user feedback. The feedback received from these activities helped us understand the application's usability strengths, areas for improvement, and the importance of feedback in the design process. We will continue to incorporate these insights into our design approach as we move forward to ensure a user-centric and effective application. Overall, the project is progressing positively, and we are committed to delivering a high-quality application that meets the needs of our users. With further iterations and refinements, we anticipate a successful Phase III and the finalization of the application. We are confident that our efforts will result in a user-friendly and efficient application that will meet the project's objectives.

## Caveats

The wireframe is not the official or finished version of a website. It is not something we would have users beta test it is just used to get a general idea across.

The cognitive walkthrough was done by fellow students and the SE team. Not giving us a broad view, because it was a very small sample of people who are developing their own projects and know how the process is done. 

The informal feedback was done by a small group of peers and we only got feedback from about 2 or 3 people. Generally, we would hope to have more people look over it and get more sources of feedback.
